# TSBase
A base theme for Drupal 8 using Bourbon & Neat.
Uses Gulp for the taskrunner.

Download repo to themes folder, for example, `/themes/tsbase`, and run `npm install`.

After installation, simply run `gulp` from that directory.

NOTE: This theme uses the 2.x version of neat, so `outer-container` et. al., have been replaced with `grid-container`. The `grid-visual` is set in `sass/layout/_page.scs`, which should be your starting point when theming.
